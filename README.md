- User-friendly UI with basic styling
- Error handling for invalid city names or API errors

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage
- **CSS**: Styling for the website
- **JavaScript**: Fetching and displaying API data
- **Weather API**: Provides real-time weather data
- **Postman**: Used for API testing

## Setup & Usage
### Prerequisites
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
